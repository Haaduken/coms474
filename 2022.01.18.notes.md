## There are 3 types of machine learned

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

### Supervised Learning

- Classification
  - Predict a label
- Progression
  - Predict an output

Parametric Regression  
SVMs  
Decision Trees  
K Nearest Neighbors  
Neural Network

### Unsupervised Learning

Learn the structure of the data  
Clustering (K-Means)  
Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

### Reinforcement Learning

Learn about the world as you interact with it  
Multi-Armed Bandit (Exploration vs Exploitation)  
Markov Decision Processes  
Q-Learning

## Supervised Learning
### Predict a feature Y (Salary) using other features X, W, and Z (Grades)  
Dataset

| Sample ID | X (474 Grade) | Y (Salary) [$10k] |
| :-------- | :-----------: | ----------------: |
| 1         |      70       |                 5 |
| 2         |      100      |                 8 |
| 3         |      80       |                10 |
| 4         |      60       |                 6 |
| ...       |      ...      |               ... |
| new       |      95       |                 ? |
| new       |      60       |                 ? |
| new       |      85       |                 ? |

### Strategies for guessing new values
- By graphing this and fitting a model, you can determine a rough estimate where their salaries may lay
  - Linear Regression
- Look-up
  - Try to find the nearest past sample and make an guess around that
  - Sample 4 and the second new sample have the same grade, so the pay may be close

Linear: `f(X) = a0 + a1*X`  
Constant: `f(X) = a0`  
Quadtratic: `f(X) = a0 + a1*X + a2*X^2`  
These are all 'Parametric' -- meaning the whole fucntion is fully determined by a few numbers (`a0, a1, a2`)

***We only care about predicting future samples*** - not how well we fit past data

At issue is the past data is all we have to pick a model (or pick a method for prediction) 

#### A big question to keep in mind: 
Is the past data representative?  
Current slaries may be higher than two years ago, may be much higher than right after the 2001 tech bubble...
