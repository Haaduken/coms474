## Problem 1
### [16 points; 4 each part] 
For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whetherwe would generally expect the performance of fitted models on future data the be better orworse if the model class has many degrees of freedom (e.g. class of high degree polynomials)compared to a model class with few degrees of freedoms (e.g. constant or linear functions). Briefly explain why (1-3 sentences).

(a). The number of samples n is large, and the number of features p is small.  
(b). The number of features p is large, and the number of samples n is small.  
(c). The relationship between the features {X1, . . . , Xp} and the response (Y ) is highly non-linear.  
(d). The variance of the noise terms, i.e. σ2 = V ar(ε), is extremely high.

## Problem 2 
### [18 points total; 6 each part] 
You will now think of some real-life applications for machine learning.

(a). Describe three real-life applications in which classification might be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors.  
(b). Describe three real-life applications in which regression might be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors.  
(c). Describe three real-life applications in which cluster analysis might be useful.
